?README-AGL.md: The Automotive Grade Linux Distribution
======================================================

[AGL](https://www.automotivelinux.org/) is creating an automotive specific Linux distribution (AGL UCB)
that unifies the software that has been written in a number of places already,
such as GENIVI and Tizen IVI.

The layer 'meta-agl' provides a minimal set of software
to boot system of AGL Distribution. 'meta-agl' is the minimal
core which is used build AGL profiles on top of it.

The reference UI is part of 'meta-agl-demo'.

Additional components like the security framework are part of 'meta-agl-extra'.

The AGL community appreciates feedback, ideas, suggestion, bugs and
documentation just as much as code. Please join the irc conversation
at the #automotive channel on irc.freenode.net and our mailing list.
